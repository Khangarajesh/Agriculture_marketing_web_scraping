1)"While selecting a commodity, state, district, etc.,
  I was encountering the error message: selenium.common.exceptions.StaleElementReferenceException: Message: Stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document.

2)Sometimes, the selection was successful, but sometimes it was not.

3)This was happening because the xpath was dynamic, which caused this error.

4)To resolve this, I wrote the xpath based on the label name, found the common parent for both, and then wrote the xpath for the element.

5)For example, the xpath for the label 'state': //td[.= , common parent: "State"]/parent::, and the xpath for the element: tr//select.

6)It is very important to wait for the page to load before moving on to the next dropbox,
  so I have written time.sleep(10).

7)Note that this solution was applicable only for the select type of dropbox. Some dropboxes use div in their HTML, so the code will change for them."
